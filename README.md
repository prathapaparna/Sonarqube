# Sonarqube
- In SonarQube, issues in code are categorized into three primary types: Bugs, Code Smells, and Vulnerabilities.

**bugs:**

- **Null pointer:** Using a variable that might be null without checking it first.
- **Incorrect condition:** Logical errors in if/else conditions that result in wrong outcomes.

**code smell:**

- **Duplicated code:** Copying and pasting the same code block in multiple places.
- **Long methods:** Methods that are too long and do too much, making them hard to understand and maintain.
- **Dead code:** Unused variables, methods, or classes that are never called.

**Vulnerabilities**
- Vulnerabilities are security-related issues in the code  by an attacker. where the application leading to security breaches, data leaks, or unauthorized access.
- Hard-coded credentials: Storing passwords or API keys directly in the code.
